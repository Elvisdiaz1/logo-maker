# <Svg-Logo-Maker>

## Description

This application was built for the purposes of creating a svg logo. This logo maker can allow you to create a quick and simple logo.svg by answering some prompts in the terminal. The application was created by using node.js, file system, and inquirer. The reason why I did this application was so I can have a method to create a simple logo that was easy to do and automated. I also have some test to ensure that the program runs as it supposed to. I learned how to use use Object Oriented programing and jest to create a prompt based application to create logos.

## Installation

To install this application, you need clone the repository. To clone the repository, you go to the green button on the repository that says "< > Code". Then you can choose to copy either the https url or the ssh url if you have a ssh key. After you copy the link, then you go to your terminal on your computer and in the terminal, you change the current directory to the directory you want to place the cloned repository in and then you type "git clone" and paste the url. Finally, you hit enter and the repository will be on your machine.

## Usage

Since this is a terminal based application, there is not much in terms of how to use it. All you need to do is open the terminal in your code editor or machine and go to the index.js in the folder. Then type "node index" to start the prompts. You will see questions which you will have to type the responses for in the terminal and also there is a choices question for selecting the shape you want the logo to be. The three choices are circles, squares, and triangles so you have to go to the answer you want via the up and down keys and hit the spacebar to select. Then hit the "enter" key to confirm your choice. For the text, you can only enter up to three characters. To find the list of colors you can use, you can google the color codes of the color you want to find the exact color name of the color you want. After you answered all the questions, a "generated logo.svg" text line will appear to show that you have made the svg logo file. So take the svg file and paste it into your own application for your use.
